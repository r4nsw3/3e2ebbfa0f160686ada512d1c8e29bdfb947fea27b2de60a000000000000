  |   With a ragtag band of adventurers, you'll engage in well-balanced,    |
  |   turn-based battles and embark on quests across the kingdom of         |
  |   Erdrea. Forge gear, develop party members' skills, and alter their    |
  |   outfits without changing gear in this edition of the game! This       |
  |   version also lets you ride and attack with monsters on the field to   |
  |   earn experience points, as well as change between HD or 16-bit        |
  |   visuals, symphonic or synth music, and English or Japanese audio.     |
  |   Complete the tale with new character-focused stories, and travel to   |
  |   past DRAGON QUEST worlds!                                             |

  |   Across the land, you'll meet the mysterious Tockles - creatures       |
  |   that allow you to visit 2D, 16-bit versions of areas from popular     |
  |   entries in the series like DRAGON QUEST IV and DRAGON QUEST VIII!     |
  |   It's fun to see these classic worlds reimagined in retro style,       |
  |   meshing perfectly with the main game's 2D mode. Like all past         |
  |   DRAGON QUEST games, this one's character designs are based on the     |
  |   signature style of famed artist Akira Toriyama. Paired with the       |
  |   voiced dialogue, the rich personalities of your most loyal            |
  |   companions and fiercest enemies are brought to life, so you can       |
  |   fully immerse yourself in this quest to discover the Luminary's       |
  |   true heritage and awaken your power. For a greater challenge, start   |
  |   the game with the Draconian Quest setting, and capture your           |
  |   favorite moments with Photo Mode!                                     |
